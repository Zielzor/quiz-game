# quiz-game
 
Its a simple Trivia Gama wrote in OOP as practice.
The code hsoul be pretty self explanatory but this is how it goes:
<li>
 <li>1. We create a Quiz() isntance passing a list of a questions.
 <li>2. Questions are picked in order and displayed to User.
 <li>3. User only answers True or False
 <li>4. Game ends after the questions are depleted, in this case its 12.
</li>
It should be higly reusable, it;s enough to  just switch the data.py  list of dictionaries to your own questions.
Enjoy.
